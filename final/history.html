                    <h2>Dʿmt</h2>
                    <p>The first kingdom known to have existed in Ethiopia was the kingdom of D'mt, which rose to power around the year 980 BC. Its capital was at Yeha, where a Sabaean style temple was built around 700 BC. The D'mt kingdom was influenced by the Sabaeans in Yemen. Perhaps representing a trading or military colony in some sort of symbiosis or military alliance with the civilization of Dʿmt or some other proto-Aksumite state.</p>

                    <h2>The Aksumite Kingdom</h2>
                    <p>The first verifiable kingdom of great power to rise in Ethiopia was that of Axum in the 1st century CE. It was one of many successor kingdoms to Dʿmt and was able to unite the northern Ethiopian Highlands. A bronze scepter or wand has been discovered at Atsbi Dera with an inscription mentioning "GDR of Axum". Coins showing the royal portrait began to be minted under King Endubis toward the end of the 3rd century CE.</p>

                    <h2>Zagwe Dynasty</h2>
                    <p>An Agaw lord named Mara Takla Haymanot founded the Zagwe Dynasty. The new Zagwe dynasty established its capital at Roha (also called Adefa), where they build a series of monolithic churches. These structures are traditionally ascribed to the King Gebre Mesqel Lalibela, with the city being renamed Lalibela in his honour. The Zagwe dynasty controlled a smaller area than the Aksumites, with its core in the Lasta region. </p>

                <img src="images/Yohannes.jpg" alt="Yohannes">
                <p>Yohannes IV (Tigrinya: ዮሓንስ ፬ይ) was Emperor of Ethiopia from 1871 to his death in 1889 at the Battle of Gallabat, and king of Tigray from 1869 to 1871. In his earlier years, he rebelled against Tewodros II; having risen to power in the 1860s, he maintained the policy of Tewodros, that of continued unification and also implemented a policy of touring entire regions and meetings with governors. Yohannes also worked to modernize Ethiopia's economy and infrastructure, introducing new technologies and encouraging trade and industry. He built roads and bridges, established a postal system, and initiated reforms to improve agriculture and education. He was a strong advocate for Ethiopian unity and worked to bring together the country's diverse regions and ethnic groups. </p>
