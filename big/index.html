        <h2>Ashenda</h2>
        <p>
          Ashenda (Amharic: አሸንዳ) is a national festival celebrated by Tigrayian
          girls. Although Ashenda is celebrated primarily by teenage girls,
          females of all age group get to participate in this national festival,
          during this festival men are expected to be on their best behavior.

        <p>
          Prior to the celebration, groups of girls make preparations for the
          holiday by buying new clothes, visiting hairdressers, preparing drums
          and harvesting the distinctive 'Ashenda' grass (which will be tied
          around their waist for the celebration).

        <h2>Tigray History</h2>
        <p>
          The Kingdom of Aksum was a trading empire rooted in northern Ethiopia.
          It existed from approximately 100–940 AD.The Empire of Aksum, at its
          height, at times extended across most of present-day Eritrea,
          Ethiopia, Djibouti, Sudan, Yemen and Saudi Arabia.The city of Axum was
          once a bustling metropolis and a cultural and economic hub. Two hills
          and two streams lie on the east and west expanses of the city; perhaps
          providing the initial impetus for settling this area. Along the hills
          and plain outside the city, the Aksumites had cemeteries with
          elaborate grave stones, which are called stelae, or obelisks.
